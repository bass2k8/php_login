PHP Login System
================

**NOTE:** This repository may modularize into **two** seperate repositories (one for Database, one for the Login System). I have mainly developed the database back-end and have completed disregarded the actual php login system.

The Database class uses **PDO** to make connections to a database; this enables us to use a vast collection of database drivers and also allows us to prepare statements. I am very pleased with the database back-end and would like users' to **test it out for me**, and provide me with any bugs they encounter, as well as letting me know how I can improve it.

Documentation has **not** been implemented yet for the methods, but will make sure they're added to the next commit.
